When making changes to any application (code), these are the steps:

git add .
// "I want to include these changes”

git commit -m "name of the commit, like fixed xyz bug"
// “Save these changes and add this short explainer”

git push origin master
// "Now finally share it"
// And specify which branch, like "master" / "main" / "branch xyz"

Basically: "pack" → "label" → "ship" the code for all to see.
