# AI Maker Bootcamp

Welcome to FB's first ever repository! 🎉

## About

This repository was created as part of the **AI Maker Bootcamp** course on Codecademy. It serves as a monorepo containing all bootcamp projects and experimental work.

## Repository Structure

This is organized as a monorepo containing:

- **Week-n folders**: Course projects organized by week (e.g., `Week-1/`, `Week-2/`, etc.)
- **Test projects**: Small experimental projects like `Grumpy-Cat/` and `Excursion/`

## Projects

### Excursion
A landing page project featuring travel destination content.

### Grumpy Cat
A small test project exploring web development fundamentals.

## Learning Journey

This repository tracks my progress through the AI Maker Bootcamp, documenting both structured coursework and independent exploration.
